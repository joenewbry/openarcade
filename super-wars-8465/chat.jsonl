I'm here to help you create an HTML5 game from scratch.\n\nWhat kind of game shall we make?\nYOU\n# Neon Labyrinth — 3D First-Person Dungeon Crawler\n\nBuild a **3D first-person dungeon crawler** as a single `index.html` file. The player explores a procedurally generated neon-lit labyrinth, fights enemies with spell attacks, collects loot, and defeats a boss to escape.\n\n## Core Requirements\n\n### Rendering & Camera\n- Three.js for 3D rendering (load from CDN)\n- First-person camera with mouse-look (pointer lock) and WASD movement\n- Collision detection against maze walls so the player can't walk through them\n- Smooth movement with acceleration/deceleration, not instant stops\n- Minimap overlay in the corner showing explored areas\n\n### Maze Generation\n- Procedurally generate a different maze each playthrough using recursive backtracking or Prim's algorithm\n- Maze should be at least 15x15 cells, with rooms of varying sizes connected by corridors\n- Place the boss room at the farthest point from the player's spawn\n- Scatter treasure chests, health pickups, and ammo caches in dead ends\n\n### Lighting & Atmosphere\n- Dynamic point lights on wall-mounted torches that flicker using sine wave + noise\n- Player carries a glowing orb that illuminates nearby walls with a warm radius\n- Neon accent strips on walls (cyan, magenta, electric blue) using emissive materials\n- Fog that increases deeper in the dungeon, reducing visibility\n- Particle effects: floating dust motes, torch sparks, spell impact particles\n\n### Combat System\n- **Fireball**: Left-click shoots a glowing projectile that travels forward, explodes on contact with walls or enemies, deals area damage, and spawns particle burst\n- **Ice Shard**: Right-click shoots a fast piercing projectile that slows enemies\n- Cooldown timers shown on the HUD for e","assistant":"Wow, this is an incredibly detailed vision! Neon Labyrinth sounds like a fantastic project — a 3D first-person dungeon crawler with procedural generation, spell combat, and that gorgeous neon-lit aesthetic. I love the contrast of dark dungeon atmosphere with vibrant neon accents.\n\nI can see you've thought through a lot of the mechanics already. Let me confirm a few key details to make sure I capture your vision perfectly:\n\n**For combat balance**: You mentioned fireball (AoE) and ice shard (piercing/slow) — how many hits should a basic enemy take to defeat, and how tough should the boss be in comparison? Are we talking 2-3 hits for grunts and a 30-second boss fight, or something more intense?"}
