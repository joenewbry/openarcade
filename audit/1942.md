# 1942 Audit
## Verdict: **PASS**
### A. Will It Work?
- [x] Imports `Game` from `../engine/core.js`
- [x] Exports `createGame()` correctly
- [x] DOM refs match: `#score`, `#best`, `#lives` all present in v2.html
- [x] Callbacks assigned: `onInit`, `onUpdate`, `onDraw` all set
- [x] `game.start()` called
- [x] No undefined functions — all helper fns defined in module scope
- [x] Valid API usage: `fillRect`, `fillCircle`, `fillPoly`, `strokePoly`, `drawLine`, `setGlow`, `drawText` all correct

### B. Is It Playable?
- [x] Start trigger: SPACE in waiting state
- [x] Controls: Arrow keys for movement, SPACE for fire, Shift or double-tap SPACE for roll
- [x] Game over condition: lives reach 0
- [x] Restart: SPACE in over state calls `game.onInit()`
- [x] No stuck states — waves auto-spawn when all enemies cleared

### C. Will It Be Fun?
- [x] Difficulty progression: wave count and enemy types scale with `waveNumber`, boss spawns at score thresholds
- [x] No impossible states — player can dodge with roll, fire rate is reasonable
- [x] Balance: 3 lives, power-ups (double shot, speed boost) add variety
- [x] Feedback: explosions, particles, glow effects, power-up timer bars
