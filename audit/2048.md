# 2048 Audit
## Verdict: **PASS**
### A. Will It Work?
- [x] Imports `Game` from `../engine/core.js`
- [x] Exports `createGame()` correctly
- [x] DOM refs match: `#score`, `#best` present in v2.html
- [x] Callbacks assigned: `onInit`, `onUpdate`, `onDraw` all set
- [x] `game.start()` called
- [x] No undefined functions
- [x] Valid API usage

### B. Is It Playable?
- [x] Start trigger: any arrow key or SPACE in waiting state
- [x] Controls: Arrow keys for tile sliding
- [x] Game over condition: `canMove()` returns false after spawn
- [x] Restart: any key in over state calls `game.onInit()`
- [x] No stuck states — animation system handles queued moves properly

### C. Will It Be Fun?
- [x] Difficulty progression: inherent to 2048 mechanics — board fills up over time
- [x] No impossible states — standard 2048 rules
- [x] Balance: 90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4 on spawn
- [x] Feedback: slide animations, spawn animations with scale, glow effects on higher tiles
