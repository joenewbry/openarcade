# Audit: Territory Control MMO

## A) Works?
YES. Hex-grid strategy game with unique layout: uses DOM panels for UI (res-panel, info-panel, build-panel, action-log, turn-info) alongside canvas rendering for the hex map. Canvas 600x500. Custom overlay handling with a START GAME button instead of keyboard start. Uses `game.canvas` to access canvas element for mouse events. `onStateChange` callback used for injecting restart button on game over.

## B) Playable?
YES. Turn-based strategy: click hexes to select, build structures (fort, barracks, market), train troops (infantry, cavalry, siege), claim neutral territory with outposts, attack enemy hexes. Two AI factions (Dominion, Horde) take turns after player. 30-turn limit. Resources: food, ore, wood, gold -- generated by owned terrain types. End Turn button advances the turn. Win condition: most territory at turn 30.

## C) Fun?
YES. Solid 4X-lite strategy game. AI is competent: builds barracks, trains troops, expands, attacks borders, moves troops toward front lines. Resource management creates meaningful decisions. Attack system with randomized combat rolls adds tension. Hex grid with proper neighbor calculation and cube-coordinate distance. Visual feedback with faction colors, hover/select highlights, attack target indicators.

## Issues
- The `game.state` is set to 'waiting' but the transition to 'playing' is handled by a DOM button (#start-btn) calling `game.setState('playing')`, not by engine input. This works but is non-standard.
- `updateResourcePanel()` and `updateScore()` are called every frame in `onDraw`, which is expensive (DOM manipulation per frame). Functionally fine but could cause minor performance issues.
- The overlay uses a custom structure with `#overlayTitle` and `#overlayText` as div elements rather than h2/p, but the engine's `showOverlay` should still work since it targets those IDs.
- `game.overlay` is accessed directly at line 544 to manipulate the overlay DOM for the game-over screen. This is engine-internal access but works in practice.

## Verdict: PASS
