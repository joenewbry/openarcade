# Lights Out Audit

## Verdict: **PASS**

## A. Will It Work? (Initialization & Runtime)
- [x] Imports engine correctly (`import { Game } from '../engine/core.js'`)
- [x] Exports `createGame()` function
- [x] DOM refs in game.js match elements in v2.html (`#score`, `#best`)
- [x] `onInit`, `onUpdate`, `onDraw` callbacks all defined and assigned to `game`
- [x] `game.start()` called
- [x] No calls to undefined functions
- [x] No infinite loops in game logic
- [x] Valid Renderer API usage (fillRect, drawLine, setGlow)
- [x] Valid TextRenderer API usage (drawText)

Notes:
- Module-scope DOM refs without null checks, but v2.html provides both elements.
- Frame-based timers for level complete delay (`solvedDelayFrames`) and game over delay (`gameOverDelayFrames`).
- Click handler on canvas handles state transitions and grid clicks.

## B. Is It Playable? (Controls & Game Flow)
- [x] Start trigger exists (SPACE, arrow keys, or click transitions from 'waiting' to 'playing')
- [x] Controls mapped (mouse click on grid cells to toggle lights)
- [x] Game over condition exists (exceed max clicks for level)
- [x] Restart works (SPACE, arrow keys, Enter, or click in 'over' state)
- [x] No stuck/dead-end states (max clicks limit ensures game ends)
- [x] Mouse-based game has click/mousemove/mouseleave handlers

## C. Will It Be Fun? (Game Design)
- [x] Difficulty progression exists (more toggles per level, max clicks scale)
- [x] No impossible states (puzzles generated by reverse-solving from blank board)
- [x] Balance: generous click limits relative to optimal solutions
- [x] Visual feedback on actions (hover highlighting shows affected neighbors, glow on lit cells, click counter color warning)
- [x] Level progression with scoring based on efficiency
