ARCADE-028,gm,critical,Fix Speed Reduction When Shooting/Moving,"Holding Space to shoot activates focus mode (state.focusActive = input.isDown Space) which reduces speed to 3px/frame. Separate focus mode from shoot key.",implemented,19,2026-03-01
ARCADE-029,gm,important,Improve Sprite Graphics,"Generated sprites not quite right. Planes should look clearly top-down. Enemies should be single distinct entities not clustered. Regenerate problem sprites.",implemented,23,2026-03-01
