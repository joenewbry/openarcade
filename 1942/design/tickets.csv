ARCADE-022,gm,critical,Allow Shooting Before First Wave,"Players can't shoot until enemies appear. Root cause: intro dialogue blocks shooting via !state.dialogue condition in fire check. Allow firing during dialogue.",open,,
ARCADE-023,gm,important,First Wave Should Be Single Planes,"Wave 1 spawns 8 scouts in vee formation which is confusing. First wave should be 3-4 single planes coming one at a time in a simple line pattern.",open,,
ARCADE-024,gm,important,Early Enemy Bullets Should Go Straight Down,"Early enemies in C1 fire aimed shots at player. Wave 1-5 enemies should fire bullets straight down (vy only no vx). Aimed shots can come in later waves/campaigns.",open,,
ARCADE-025,gm,critical,Fix HUD Not Displaying,"All HUD text (score lives bombs chain graze roll stocks etc.) not showing. Icons not visible. Critical rendering issue.",open,,
ARCADE-026,gm,important,Add Parallax Scrolling Tile Background,"Background shows horizon gradient view. Should be top-down scrolling tiled background with parallax depth layers (slow bg layer + faster foreground clouds).",open,,
ARCADE-027,gm,important,Scale Up First Boss,"First boss takes up almost no screen space. Bosses should be imposing. Increase BOSS_SCALE significantly and ensure boss sprites render at larger size.",open,,
ARCADE-028,gm,critical,Fix Speed Reduction When Shooting/Moving,"Holding Space to shoot activates focus mode (state.focusActive = input.isDown Space) which reduces speed to 3px/frame. Separate focus mode from shoot key.",open,,
ARCADE-029,gm,important,Improve Sprite Graphics,"Generated sprites not quite right. Planes should look clearly top-down. Enemies should be single distinct entities not clustered. Regenerate problem sprites.",open,,
