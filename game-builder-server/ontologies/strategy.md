# Strategy Game Design Ontology

## Key Design Questions
- Turn-based or real-time? Or hybrid (pause-and-plan)?
- Scope: tactical (squad) or strategic (civilization)?
- Resources: how many types? Gathering mechanics?
- Units: rock-paper-scissors counters? Upgrade paths?
- Map: grid, hex, free-form? Fog of war?
- Win condition: elimination, objective, score, survival?

## Common Patterns
- **Resource management**: Spend now vs save for later
- **Tech tree**: Unlock advanced units/abilities over time
- **Fog of war**: Information asymmetry drives scouting
- **Counter system**: Every unit type has strengths and weaknesses
- **Chokepoints**: Map geometry creates strategic decisions
- **Economy vs military**: Balancing growth against defense

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- One dominant strategy (rush, turtle) with no counter
- Too many resources to track simultaneously
- AI that cheats instead of playing smarter
- Analysis paralysis from too many options per turn
- Snowballing: early advantage becomes insurmountable

## Reference Games
Chess, Civilization, StarCraft, XCOM, Fire Emblem, Into the Breach
