# Roguelike Design Ontology

## Key Design Questions
- Permadeath: full reset or meta-progression between runs?
- Generation: procedural rooms, levels, or world?
- Combat: real-time action, turn-based, card-based?
- Build variety: items, skills, synergies, classes?
- Run length: 20 min, 1 hour, multi-session?
- Difficulty scaling: floor-based, adaptive, selectable?

## Common Patterns
- **Procedural generation**: Rooms/levels assembled from templates
- **Item synergies**: Combining items creates emergent strategies
- **Meta-progression**: Permanent unlocks across runs
- **Risk/reward rooms**: Optional challenge for better loot
- **Shop system**: Spend currency mid-run for upgrades
- **Boss checkpoints**: Major milestones per run

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Runs that feel identical (not enough variety)
- Must-pick items that make other choices irrelevant
- Unfair deaths from information the player couldn't have
- Too much meta-progression (early runs feel pointless)
- Seed-dependent difficulty (some runs unwinnable)

Hades, Slay the Spire, The Binding of Isaac, Dead Cells, Spelunky, Risk of Rain
