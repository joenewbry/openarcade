# Puzzle Game Design Ontology

## Key Design Questions
- Core mechanic: matching, physics, logic, spatial, word?
- Time pressure: timed, turn-based, or untimed?
- Progression: fixed levels, endless, procedural?
- Difficulty curve: tutorial levels, gradual mechanic introduction?
- Scoring: score-based, star rating, completion-only?
- Undo/reset: can the player undo moves or restart?

## Common Patterns
- **Match-3 cascade**: Chain reactions from gravity + matches
- **Teach by doing**: First levels are implicit tutorials
- **One new mechanic per zone**: Introduce, explore, combine
- **Par/optimal solutions**: Optional challenge for completionists
- **Hint system**: Timed hints for stuck players
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indication of valid/invalid moves

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Unsolvable randomly-generated puzzles
- Solutions that require trial-and-error, not logic
- Too many mechanics introduced too fast
- No clear visual language for interactive vs decorative elements
- Difficulty plateaus (too easy for too long, then sudden spike)
