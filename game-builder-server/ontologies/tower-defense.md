# Tower Defense Design Ontology

## Key Design Questions
- Path type: fixed paths, mazing (player-built), or hybrid?
- Tower types: how many? Upgrade trees or flat?
- Enemy waves: fixed or procedural? Boss waves?
- Economy: gold per kill, passive income, interest?
- Terrain: elevation bonuses? Water/land types?
- Win/lose: lives system, single-fail, score-based?

## Common Patterns
- **Rock-paper-scissors**: Armor types vs damage types
- **Choke points**: Map design creates natural tower clusters
- **Splash vs single**: AoE towers for swarms, single-target for tanks
- **Slow + DPS combo**: Utility towers synergize with damage towers
- **Wave preview**: Show upcoming enemies before wave starts
- **Fast-forward**: Speed up between waves

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- One optimal tower/strategy that trivializes all maps
- Waves that feel identical in composition
- No visual distinction between upgraded towers
- Economy too generous (trivial) or too tight (frustrating)
- Enemies that bypass all strategy (flying without counters)
