# Fighting Game Design Ontology

## Key Design Questions
- Combat system: 2D traditional, arena, platform fighter?
- Input complexity: simple (2-3 buttons) or deep (6-button + motions)?
- Combo system: dial-a-combo, chain, cancel-based, juggle?
- Frame data: how important? Light/medium/heavy speed tiers?
- Character count: how many fighters? Unique movesets?
- Defensive options: block, parry, dodge, pushblock?

## Common Patterns
- **Hitstun/blockstun**: Frames of immobility on hit/block
- **Startup/active/recovery**: Every move has these three phases
- **Priority system**: Heavy beats light, anti-air beats jump-in
- **Meter/super**: Build meter through hits, spend on supers
- **Health bars**: Usually 2 rounds, best of 3
- **Knockdown/wakeup**: Mixup opportunities on knockdown

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Infinite combos without escape mechanics
- One dominant strategy with no counterplay
- Unreadable attack animations
- Input lag making execution feel unresponsive
- No tutorial for special move inputs

## Reference Games
Street Fighter, Tekken, Smash Bros, Guilty Gear, Mortal Kombat
