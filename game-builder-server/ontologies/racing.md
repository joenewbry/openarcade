# Racing Game Design Ontology

## Key Design Questions
- Realism: arcade physics or simulation?
- Perspective: top-down, behind-car, isometric?
- Track design: circuits, point-to-point, open world?
- Vehicles: cars, ships, bikes? Customization?
- Power-ups/items: Mario Kart style or pure racing?
- Opponents: AI racers, ghost replays, multiplayer?

## Common Patterns
- **Drifting**: Risk/reward mechanic for corners
- **Boost/nitro**: Limited speed burst resource
- **Rubber banding**: AI adjusts to keep races competitive
- **Shortcuts**: Hidden risky paths that save time
- **Vehicle stats**: Speed, acceleration, handling tradeoffs
- **Progressive unlock**: Win races to unlock new tracks/vehicles

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Collision physics that feel unfair (spin out too easily)
- Tracks with blind corners and no warning
- AI that's either trivial or impossibly fast
- Camera that doesn't handle turns well
- No sense of speed (need motion blur, FOV changes)

## Reference Games
Mario Kart, F-Zero, Wipeout, Need for Speed, TrackMania
