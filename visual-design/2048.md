# 2048 — Visual & Sound Design

## Current Aesthetic
The game uses a dark navy board (`#0d1525`) with a neon tile color progression from muted blue-grey for low values up to `#ff22ff` magenta for tile 8192. Tiles glow with intensity proportional to their value, and animated slide/merge/spawn transitions use easeInOutQuad easing. Text is white with subtle size scaling.

## Aesthetic Assessment
The neon-on-dark approach is tasteful and readable, with a clear visual progression that rewards high-value tiles. The glow system gives satisfying feedback on merges. What's missing: the progression feels generic — there's no thematic identity to make this feel different from a dozen other 2048 clones. The tile transitions are smooth but the board itself has no personality, no texture, no ambient life. The palette escalation could be more dramatic.
**Score: 3/5**

## Visual Redesign Plan

### Background & Environment
Replace the flat dark navy with a deep space theme to complement the exponential-growth fantasy: a near-black background (`#050510`) with a subtle star field — 80 tiny white dots at varied `rgba` opacity (0.2–0.8), fixed positions. Add a soft radial glow emanating from the board center using a large ellipse at `rgba(30,20,80,0.4)`. The board surface itself gets a faint hexagonal grid overlay at `rgba(255,255,255,0.03)` — barely perceptible but adds depth. A thin outer board border in `rgba(100,80,200,0.3)` with a slow pulse animation (0.8Hz sine wave) gives the board a living quality.

### Color Palette
- Tile 2: `#1a2040` background, `#8899cc` text
- Tile 4: `#1e2850` background, `#aabbdd` text
- Tile 8: `#1a3060` background, `#55aaff` text — first "real" glow
- Tile 16: `#0d2244` background, `#33ddff` text — cyan glow
- Tile 32: `#1a1a50` background, `#8866ff` text — purple glow
- Tile 64: `#220044` background, `#cc44ff` text — magenta-purple
- Tile 128: `#440022` background, `#ff44aa` text — pink
- Tile 256: `#441100` background, `#ff6600` text — amber
- Tile 512: `#442200` background, `#ffaa00` text — gold
- Tile 1024: `#441400` background, `#ffdd00` text — yellow
- Tile 2048: `#202000` background, `#ffffff` text — white with heavy bloom
- Tile 4096+: Cycling rainbow with full glow bloom
- Board background: `#050510`
- Board grid lines: `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`

### Entity Redesigns
**Tiles**: Add corner radii (use fillRect with clipping or draw rounded polygon). Each tile has two glow layers: a faint wide blur (radius = tile size * 0.6) and a tight bright halo (radius = tile size * 0.1). Tile number text uses a clean sans-serif with a matching colored drop shadow offset 1px. On merge, emit a brief burst of 8 tiny diamond particles in the tile's color that drift outward and fade over 20 frames.

**Board grid**: Draw the 4x4 cell outlines as dim rounded rectangles before tiles are placed, so empty cells are visible as dark recessed slots.

**Merge animation**: On merge, the receiving tile briefly overshoots scale to 1.25 before settling to 1.0 over 8 frames (spring easing). The incoming tile shrinks to 0 as it reaches the merge point.

**New tile spawn**: Scale from 0 to 1.15 then settle to 1.0 over 12 frames. A thin ring pulse emanates outward and fades.

**2048 achievement**: When tile 2048 is first formed, freeze all animation for 3 frames, then trigger a full-board screen flash at `rgba(255,255,255,0.3)` that fades over 20 frames, plus a ring of 24 gold particles spiraling outward from the tile.

### Particle & Effect System
**Merge burst**: 8 particles per merge in tile color, each a 2×2 square, velocity 1.5–3px outward at random angle, fade over 20 frames.

**Score popup**: When tiles merge, a score number floats upward from the merge point: bright white text, drift 20px up over 40 frames, fade in last 15 frames.

**Glow pulse**: High-value tiles (128+) have a continuous slow glow pulse: glow radius oscillates ±3px at 0.5Hz.

**Board shake**: On invalid move (no tiles moved), the board shakes horizontally ±4px over 6 frames — 3 oscillations.

**Game over overlay**: Dark vignette grows from corners inward over 30 frames, then "GAME OVER" text slides in from top.

### UI Polish
Score at top-center in sharp white with a small `#aabbdd` label. Best score in top-right, same style. Score increment animation: when score increases, the counter briefly scales to 1.2 and returns over 10 frames. High-value tile count indicator (e.g., "Highest: 512") in small text below score. Restart button as a minimal rounded rectangle with hover glow. Keyboard hints as tiny dim text at bottom.

### Sound Events & Synthesis

| Event | Synthesis type | Frequency/params | Duration | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|----------|-------|
| Tile slide | Oscillator (sine) | 200Hz → 280Hz sweep | 80ms | Very soft, attack 5ms, fast decay |
| Tile merge (low, 2+4) | Oscillator (sine) + harmonic | 330Hz + 660Hz, chord | 120ms | Soft chime quality |
| Tile merge (mid, 16+32) | Sine arpeggio | 440Hz → 550Hz, 30ms each | 100ms | Brighter tone |
| Tile merge (high, 128+) | Sine chord + reverb tail | 523Hz + 784Hz + 1047Hz | 300ms | Rich bell chord |
| Tile merge (2048) | Sine fanfare + noise bloom | 440→660→880→1320Hz, 60ms each | 400ms | Triumphant arpeggio |
| New tile spawn | Oscillator (triangle) | 600Hz, brief ping | 40ms | Near-silent, subtle |
| Invalid move | Noise burst + highpass 2kHz | White noise, short decay | 60ms | Subtle dry click |
| Game over | Sine descend | 440→330→220→110Hz, 200ms each | 800ms | Falling tone, sad |
| New high score | Sine arpeggio ascending | 523→659→784→1047Hz, 80ms each | 350ms | Bright achievement chime |
| Board appear (start) | Sine sweep up | 110→440Hz | 300ms | Rising tone, game start |

### Music/Ambience
A near-silent ambient pad: two sine oscillators at 55Hz and 82.5Hz (perfect fifth) blended at very low gain (0.03), with slow LFO amplitude modulation at 0.05Hz — barely perceptible, suggesting infinite digital space. As the highest tile value increases, the base frequency of the ambient drone shifts upward by one semitone per power-of-two tier (55Hz at tile 2, slowly rising toward 110Hz at tile 2048), giving the player a subliminal sense of mounting tension and elevation.

## Implementation Priority
- High: Tile glow color palette, merge burst particles, spring-easing merge animation
- Medium: Star field background, score float popups, board shake on invalid move
- Low: Ambient drone pitch shift, 2048-achievement particle spiral, board pulse border
