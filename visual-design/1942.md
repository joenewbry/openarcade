# 1942 — Visual & Sound Design

## Current Aesthetic
The game has a deep navy ocean background (`#0a1628`) with procedurally-placed island polygons and wave lines scrolling downward at 1.5px/frame. The player plane is a cyan-green (`#6db`) polygon with a cockpit detail and engine glow, while enemies come in red fighters, orange bombers, and magenta aces. Explosions are orange `#f84` circles with radius decreasing over 20 frames, and particle trails are simple 4x4 squares.

## Aesthetic Assessment
The bones are solid — player/enemy distinction is clear, parallax scrolling sells the vertical-scroller feel. What's missing: the ocean looks flat and generic (no depth, no light reflection), the islands are too small and forgettable, and explosions lack punch. The enemy designs are functional but not iconic. The Pacific Theater wartime grit and beauty of the original 1942 is absent — there's no sense of scale or drama.
**Score: 2/5**

## Visual Redesign Plan

### Background & Environment
Three-layer parallax ocean system: a deep background of muted steel-blue (`#050d1a`) with slow-moving cloud shadows crossing at 0.3px/frame as wide, nearly-transparent dark ellipses. Middle layer: scattered atolls with bright sandy centers (`#c8a84a`) surrounded by surf rings (`rgba(180,220,255,0.15)`), scrolling at 1.0px/frame. Front layer: white foam crests drawn as short, slightly curved horizontal dashes moving at 2.0px/frame. Add a distant horizon haze gradient at the top 80px fading from `#4a7a9b` to transparent, giving depth. Occasional oil slick shimmers in iridescent rainbow polygons on the water surface near explosions.

### Color Palette
- Primary (player): `#00e5ff` — ice-blue for allied aircraft
- Secondary (enemy): `#ff3d1f` — rising-sun red for Japanese air corps
- Accent (ace enemy): `#cc44ff` — threatening magenta
- Background layers: `#050d1a`, `#0a1f35`, `#1a4060`
- Glow/bloom: `#00ccff` for player, `#ff5500` for explosions
- Power-up gold: `#ffd700`

### Entity Redesigns
**Player plane**: Keep current polygon shape but add a bright white cockpit highlight, two thin engine-exhaust lines in `#ff7700` trailing behind, and a subtle `#00e5ff` glow halo. When speed-boosted, show 4 parallel exhaust lines.

**Fighter enemies**: Elongated red delta shape with a visible circular engine cowl (`#880000`) and a white-on-red tail marking. Small red glow around each one.

**Bombers**: Wide fuselage with visible bomb-bay doors (dark rectangle underneath), twin engines as circles on each wing. Orange-amber tone `#cc6600`.

**Ace enemies**: Sleek swept-wing design in magenta with a bright pink cockpit bubble and a trailing vapor contrail.

**Boss**: Massive warplane with articulated wing cannons (long thin rectangles extending from each wing), a pulsing red core visible through the fuselage, and a triple health bar.

**Bullets**: Player bullets — thin glowing cyan rods 3×12px. Enemy bullets — red circles with a short orange trail.

**Power-ups**: Spin slowly; double-shot appears as two golden bullet icons, speed boost as a lightning-bolt in electric blue.

### Particle & Effect System
**Explosion**: Two-phase — initial white flash circle (8px, 3 frames) then expanding fireball (10–40px over 25 frames) in `#ff6600` → `#ff2200` → `#660000` → transparent. Spawn 16 debris particles: 8 bright orange sparks and 8 dark smoke puffs (4px circles). Smoke puffs drift upward and fade over 40 frames.

**Hit flash**: Small 6-particle white burst, life 8 frames.

**Boss death**: Chain explosion — 5 staggered explosions across 90 frames, then a shockwave circle expanding to 120px radius.

**Engine trail**: Player emits 2 tiny `#ff7700` particles per frame from the engine nozzle, fading over 12 frames.

### UI Polish
Score in top-left in sharp sans-serif, white text with a thin `#00e5ff` drop shadow. Lives shown as tiny cyan plane silhouettes. Power-up timers as thin horizontal bars under the score, color-coded to power-up type. Roll cooldown as a small arc around a SHIFT icon. Boss health bar spans full width at top, switching red→yellow→green as health drops (reversed from normal — it gets scarier as it drops).

### Sound Events & Synthesis

| Event | Synthesis type | Frequency/params | Duration | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|----------|-------|
| Player shoot | Oscillator (square) | 880Hz → 440Hz sweep | 60ms | Short attack 2ms, fast decay |
| Double-shot | Two staggered square waves | 1020Hz + 880Hz, 5ms apart | 60ms | Slightly fuller sound |
| Enemy shoot | Oscillator (sawtooth) | 660Hz → 330Hz | 50ms | Lower, more ominous |
| Bullet hit (enemy) | Noise burst + bandpass 800Hz | White noise + 40ms decay | 80ms | Metallic ping |
| Small explosion | Noise burst + lowpass 300Hz | White noise, steep decay | 250ms | Boom with body |
| Large explosion (boss hit) | Noise burst + lowpass 150Hz | Long tail 600ms | 600ms | Deep concussive blast |
| Boss death | Noise sweep + sine LFO | 80Hz saw, wobble 3Hz | 1200ms | Dramatic fade |
| Power-up collect | Sine arpeggio | 440Hz → 660Hz → 880Hz, 80ms each | 240ms | Bright, upward |
| Player hit | Noise + highpass 1kHz | Short burst 150ms | 150ms | Harsh impact |
| Wave start | Sine chord | 220Hz + 330Hz + 440Hz | 400ms | Low tension chord |
| Level complete | Sine fanfare | 440→550→660→880Hz, 100ms each | 400ms | Victory arpeggio |

### Music/Ambience
Looping 8-bar engine drone: a low sawtooth at 55Hz with LFO modulation at 0.3Hz to simulate propeller throb. Layer a secondary loop of sporadic 2-note motifs — two triangle oscillators trading a minor third (220Hz / 261Hz) every 4 beats at 90bpm, suggesting tension. No full melody — the ambience should feel like sitting in a cockpit over the ocean.

## Implementation Priority
- High: Three-layer ocean parallax, explosion two-phase system, enemy glow redesign
- Medium: Engine exhaust trails, power-up spin animations, boss chain explosion
- Low: Oil slick iridescent shimmers, horizon haze gradient, boss triple health bar arc
