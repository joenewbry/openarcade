# 2048

## Game Type
Puzzle / tile-sliding

## Core Mechanics
- **Goal**: Combine numbered tiles by sliding them to create a tile with the value 2048 (and beyond).
- **Movement**: Slide all tiles in one of four directions per input; matching adjacent tiles merge into their sum.
- **Key interactions**: Tiles slide and merge, new tiles spawn after each valid move, game ends when no moves remain.

## Controls
- Arrow keys: slide tiles in that direction
- Any arrow key on the title screen also starts the game

## Difficulty Progression

### Structure
2048 has no explicit levels or waves — difficulty emerges purely from board state. The game starts with two random tiles on a 4x4 grid (`GRID = 4`). After each valid move, one new tile spawns: 90% chance of a `2`, 10% chance of a `4` (`Math.random() < 0.9 ? 2 : 4`). The game ends when `canMove()` returns false (no empty cells and no adjacent equal tiles).

### Key Difficulty Variables
- `GRID`: fixed at 4 (4x4 board). Changing this to 5 would dramatically extend games.
- New tile values: 90% spawn as `2`, 10% as `4`. The 4-spawn rate is the only "difficulty" variable in the spawn system.
- `ANIM_FRAMES`: ~6 frames (100ms) for slide animation.
- `SPAWN_FRAMES`: ~7 frames (120ms) for new tile pop-in animation.
- Score: accumulated from merge values only (merging two 64s gives +128 score). No time pressure.

### Difficulty Curve Assessment
The game is purely skill- and strategy-based with no external difficulty ramp — it is as hard as the player makes it through their own choices. The initial experience is very gentle (just two tiles on an empty board), making it accessible. The main frustration point is late-game when the board fills and strategic options narrow, which is inherent to the puzzle design.

## Suggested Improvements
- [ ] Consider adding a small "hint" indicator (e.g., a subtle highlight) when only one valid move type remains, to reduce frustration for new players who don't recognize zugzwang situations.
- [ ] Add a "best tile reached" display in addition to score — many players don't understand the score number but would recognize "highest tile: 512".
- [ ] Consider allowing players to choose between 3x3 (easier), 4x4 (standard), and 5x5 (harder) grid sizes from a start screen.
- [ ] Add an undo button with 1-2 uses per game to ease first-time players past the learning curve.
