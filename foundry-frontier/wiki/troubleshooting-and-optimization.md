# Troubleshooting and Optimization

## Common Failures
- Oxygen deficit cascade
- Power brownout during peak production
- Thermal runaway during Stage 3+

## Fast Recovery Playbook
1. Pause expansions and isolate critical lines.
2. Prioritize oxygen and power restoration.
3. Add buffer depots to smooth consumption spikes.
4. Re-enable mass driver lines in stages.

## Optimization Tips
- Use splitters to protect high-priority chains.
- Keep thermal sink coverage near high-energy nodes.
- Favor simpler, inspectable layouts over over-compaction.
