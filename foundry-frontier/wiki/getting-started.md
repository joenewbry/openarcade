# Getting Started

## Starting State
You start with a minimal moon outpost:
- 1 extractor
- 1 refinery
- 1 short belt path
- 1 micro battery
- low oxygen reserve

## First 20 Minutes
1. Stabilize power and oxygen.
2. Build a continuous regolith-to-feedstock loop.
3. Add storage buffers to absorb production spikes.
4. Complete Chapter 1 objectives to unlock Chapter 2 systems.

## New Player Priority
- Keep oxygen positive.
- Avoid thermal saturation.
- Build simple, legible lines before compact optimization.
